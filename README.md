## **Echo Algorithm**

**Author:** Zhijie Xu

#### **Introduction:** 

This is a coursework project of distributed algorithm in Newcastle University Computing School. This project simulates the echo algorithm using Java as programming language.

#### **Project Structureï¼š**

```
distributed_algorithm_coursework
	src
		java
			uk.co.ncl.ad.coursework
				Node.java
				RunAlgorithm.java
			resources	
				1.txt
				2.txt
				3.txt
				4.txt
```

####  **Instruction:**

1. This project is built in Intellij IDEA, please use Intellij IDEA to run it. If you only have Eclipse, please create a new Java project in Eclipse and copy two packages showed below into your "src". 

```
uk.co.ncl.ad.coursework
	Node.java
	RunAlgorithm.java
resources	
	1.txt
	2.txt
	3.txt
	4.txt
```

2. You should open the RunAlgorithm.java file, run the **main** method.

3. When the application starts, you can select one file and input the filename into the console, press **enter** button, the  algorithm will execute.
